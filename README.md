# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Task

We were tasked to review the Amazon Vine program, a program designed to have paid
people do reviews on products.  We set out to see if there was any bias toward
favorable reviews from Vine member as opposed to free paying customers on Amazon.

## Analysis. 

We reviewed sporting goods equipment for our dataset and we broke that data down 
to Vine customers verses free customers and their reviews.  Of course some obvious
items came up as there were more free reviews (61,614) than there were Vine
reviews (334) so our data may be a bit skewed due to that.  We then looked to
see what percentage of both Vine and Free users gave a five star rating to a 
product.  This percentage should even the playing field a bit between the two
reviewers.  Free reviers gave 5 stars 53% of the time verses the Vine customer
42% of time.  

## Conclusion
Althoug our data is stacked heavily toward our free customers it is still 
very difficutl to tell if the Vine users are biased.  It would be better
to analyze not just one dataset like we did with sports equipment but maybe
5-7 segments to get a bettr grasp if there may be a bias.
